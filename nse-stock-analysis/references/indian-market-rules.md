- High delivery % suggests genuine buying/selling (not speculative)
- Average delivery % varies by stock - compare to its own average

### Interpretation

|-----------|---------------|
| > 70% | Strong institutional interest |
| 50-70% | Moderate - mixed retail/institutional |
| 30-50% | Speculative activity dominates |
| < 30% | Highly speculative - mostly intraday traders |

### Delivery Breakout Signal

```
IF Today's Delivery % > 1.5 × 20-day Average Delivery %
AND Price Change > +1%
AND Volume > 1.5 × Average Volume
THEN → Institutional accumulation signal
```
